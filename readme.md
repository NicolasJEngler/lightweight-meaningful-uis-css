# Lightweight and meaningful UIs with CSS
## This is the repository of my talk proposal for CSSConf AR 2018

This presentation is based on `reveal.js`. Check out their [repo](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) if you need to know anything other than the basic setup.

In this presentation we'll be looking at how to create rich and meaningful UIs using CSS animations and transitions in order to avoid adding bloat to our codebase. CSS is pretty powerful on its own, which eliminates the need to import heavy libraries into our projects if all we want is a limited set of animations, all we need to do is think about a predefined set of rules for our animation styleguide and we're ready to go.
